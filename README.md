This code implements a weather and time display app using Streamlit, OpenWeather API, and Python's datetime and pytz libraries.

Key Components:
Imports:

datetime and pytz for handling time and time zones.
requests to interact with the OpenWeather API.
streamlit to create the web app interface.
Function get_weather:

Accepts a city_name and api_key (from Streamlit secrets).
Queries the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data (temperature, humidity, condition).
Returns a string with the weather information or an error message if the city isn't found.
Function display_date_time:

Takes in a user_timezone and an optional location_timezone.
Displays the current date and time in the user's timezone.
If a location_timezone is provided, it also shows the date and time in that timezone.
Streamlit Interface:

The app title is displayed as "Weather App".
A text input box is provided for users to enter the city name.
If a city is entered, the get_weather function fetches and displays the weather.
The app also displays the current time in "Asia/Jerusalem" (hardcoded).
